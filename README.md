# Youtube Summary Rails

**YouTube Summary Rails** is a web application that allows users to add a title, video URL, and video transcription to generate a compelling and stylish summary for their YouTube videos, helping to maximize their views. Inspired by the concepts taught in _Developing Apps with GPT-4_ from O'Reilly, this project demonstrates how to build a practical application using Ruby on Rails, despite the book's examples being in Python.

The application seamlessly integrates system components, CRUD operations, and background jobs to create a "real-world app" experience. The primary objective is to leverage GPT's AI capabilities to generate accurate and engaging summaries from video transcriptions.
